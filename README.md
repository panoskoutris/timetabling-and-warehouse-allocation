# Timetabling and Warehouse Allocation

This repository contains two real-world optimization problems modeled using **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** and solved using **Gurobi** in Python. The project demonstrates the use of mathematical modeling to address practical challenges in scheduling and logistics.

Developed as part of the course **Operations Research** at the **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH)**, School of Electrical & Computer Engineering.

##  Problem 1: School Timetabling

###  Objective

Design a weekly schedule for two different school classes, assigning subjects and teachers to specific time slots while satisfying:

- The required weekly hours for each subject
- Teacher availability
- No double-booking of teachers or classes
- Subject-teacher compatibility

###  Approach

- Modeled as a **Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP)**
- Binary decision variables represent whether a subject is taught in a specific time slot by a specific teacher in a specific class
- Solved using the `gurobipy` API

### Results

- Generated valid, conflict-free weekly timetables for both classes
- All constraints were successfully satisfied

Example output (simplified):

```
Class 1 – Monday
08:00-09:00: Math (Teacher 1)
09:00-10:00: History (Teacher 2)
...

Class 2 – Tuesday
08:00-09:00: Physics (Teacher 3)
...
```

##  Problem 2: Warehouse Allocation (Capacitated Facility Location)

###  Objective

Select a subset of 12 candidate warehouse locations to open and assign 12 service points to them, minimizing the total cost (fixed + transportation) while satisfying:

- Each service point is served by exactly one open warehouse
- Opened warehouses must respect capacity constraints

###  Given

- A 12×12 transportation cost matrix
- Fixed costs to open each warehouse
- Capacity and demand values

###  Approach

- ILP model with binary variables:
  - Whether each warehouse is opened
  - Whether each service point is assigned to a warehouse
- Constraints ensure valid assignments and capacity limits

###  Results

- Optimal selection of warehouses to open
- Each service point was assigned to exactly one open warehouse
- Total cost minimized and all constraints respected

Example (simplified):

```
Opened Warehouses: [3, 7, 9]
Assignments:
  Service Point 1 → Warehouse 3
  Service Point 2 → Warehouse 9
  ...
```
